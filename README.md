# John Conway's Game of Life


## About
The Game of Life is a computer simulation that models the behavior of simple organisms or cells arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each cell can be either "alive" or "dead", and the game applies a set of rules that determine how the cells evolve over time. The rules are based on the number of neighboring cells that are alive or dead, and they can create complex patterns that are unpredictable and beautiful. The game is a fascinating way to explore the concepts of cellular automata, and to see how simple rules can give rise to complex behavior.
